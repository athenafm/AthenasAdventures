# Montreal Travel Diary

November 2024 

During November 2024, I took a road trip to Montreal, Quebeb. i visited a couple times before and I have to say, it is one of my favourite trips around Canada. There is a European feel to the atmosphere and the food scene is endless. Below I will share some of my trip highlights. I only got the chance to stay here for a day, so I was unable to do a lot of sight-seeing, however, the places I managed to see were show-stopping!

# Hiking up Mont Royal 

During one of the days in Montreal, I took a hike up the Mont Royal Mountain. This steep mountain is is part of the Monteregian Hills situated between Laurentians and the Appalachain Mountains. Located in the downtown area, this hike will take you around 1-2 hours. This destination is popular around the fall and summer time. This time, I was able to see all the different coloured leaves which made beautiful pictures. Out of all the hikes I have taken in my lifetime, this was quite difficult, however, there are some places to rest if you get tired.

# Downtown scene

I have learned that one of my favourite things to do in Montreal is simply walking through the city. There are so many things to see and do along the way. For example, while walking, you can admire the large buildings and architecture. Old Montreal is most famous for its architecture as it gives individuals a "european feel" as there are brick roads and older buildings. Walking through downtown, you can also visit many shops and centres.

# Rating 

I would rate my time in Montreal a 9/10. The hotels are very expensive in the downtown area, however, the scenery and city-feel is absolutely amazing. I would recommend visiting this province if you enjoy the city atmosphere and environment.
