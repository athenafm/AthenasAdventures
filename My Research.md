# My Research 
My research at school consists of examining the mechanism of adaptive thermogenesis and energy metabolism. Energy metabolism consist of energy intake (the food or calories we consume) and energy expenditure (how many calories we expend for daily functioning). Weight gain occurs when energy intake exceeds energy expenditure and weight loss occurs when energy expenditure surpasses energy intake. Past research has seen that as well lose weight, our resting energy expenditure decreases which makes it harder to sustain weight loss. This resistance to weight loss in known as adaptive thermogenesis where our our resting energy expenditure decreases beyond what is predicted in terms of body composition. My research focuses on adolescents with obestiy and how their energy expenditure is different from other individuals. Below I will explain some of the core components of my project. 

What are the causes of obesity? 

Obesity is a multifaceted condition caused by a combinatino fo various factors such as genetics, environment, behaviour and physiology. Behavioural causes are related to dietary and phyiscal activity habits. High consumption of fatty foods can lead to increased weight gain. Physical inactivity can lead to sedendary lifestyles. Genetic causes are related to family history and inhertied genes affecting metabolism or hormonal imbalances of insulin, leptin or cortisol. Environmental factors such as socioeconomic status may lead to purchasing unhealthy foods as they are typically cheaper in grocery stores. Additionally, certain medications such as antidepressants or medical conditions can cause obesity or weight gain as well. There are many other factors as well, however, the most important thing to recognize is that obesity is a multifactorial issue and tailored interventions are required in order to treat this condition.

<u> Components of total daily  energy expenditure (TDEE) <u>

60-75% of TDEE comprises of Resting energy expenditure (resting energy expenditure is the energy expenditure while a peron lies quiety awake in an interprandial state. This is required for basic functions at rest such as keeping our organs functioning. 

15-30% consists of Physical activity energy expenditure (consists of any physical activity that is done throughout the day. Thi can be as simple as raising one's hand to ask a question, or running on the treadmill for 30 minutes) 

10% consists of the thermic effect of food (thermic effect of food is the increase in metabolic rate that occurs after eating a meal. it is the amount of energy it takes for your body to digest and absorb the food you eat.)

<u> What are some treatment for obesity? <U>

| Type of treatment      | Description                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Dietary modifications| Making changes to your diet is normally the first treatment option for individuals with obesity. Physicians will encourage others to ensure adolescents are receiving portion-controlled meals rich in vegetables, fruits, lean proteins and whole grains. Sugary beverages and junk food high in saturated fats such as potato chips are high calorie foods which can contribute to weight gain.|
| Physical activity modifications             | Aiming for at least 30-60 minutes of moderate exercise is a common recommendation for adolescents with obestiy. This can vary from high intensity swimming or reaching a certain amount of steps everyday. Including muscle strengthening exercises is also important to ensure that there is an adequate amount of muscle mass |
| Sleep             | Having poor sleep patterns can be linked to obesity as sleep deprivation can disrupt hormones that regulte apptetite making an individual feel more hungrier and likely to engage in food consumption         |
| Behavioural therapy| Engaging family members to create a supportive environemnt for behaviour change can also be helpful. Sometimes, parents or family are unaware of the food decisions that are made for their children. By suggesting strategies to help with this, parents can attempt to create a safe environment for their children. Additionally, sometimes feeding pattern are linked to thought patterns. It is thus important to change and recognize these patterns. 
| Pharmacological treatments| For adolescents with severe obesity, medication may considered. For example, semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist is a type of medication that is used for weight loss by decreasing appetite and energy intake. Wegovy, the brand name of semaglutide, has recently been approved for pediatric use from 12 years old.|
| Surgery| For adolescents with severe obestiy and other complications such as type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, surgical treatment is an option. Common procedures include Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and sleeve Gastrectomy. These procedures are invasive so it is important to consult a physician in order to be fully informed of the risks of this procedure.|


What is the focus of my project? 

The focus of my project involves examining how energy expenditure changes in response to a pharmacological treatment of semaglutide in adolescents with obesity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1), including semaglutide, have emerged as adjacent treatments to suppress appetite and promote weight loss4. In one of the few studies examining pharmacotherapeutic effects on EE, adults with obesity and T2D treated for one year with both metformin and a GLP-1 receptor agonist (RA) had a greater EE for fat free mass than those treated with metformin alone. This study suggests that the addition of a GLP-1 RA may protect against decreases in EE following weight loss5. However, as this research was exclusively conducted in adults, this relationship remains unexplored in adolescents. Using new state of the art whole calorimetry rooms we will measure energy expenditure using these rooms at McMaster Children's Hospital.
